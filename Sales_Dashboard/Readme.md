# PowerBI_Sales_Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on creating a **single-page Power BI dashboard** to analyze sales data from six coffee shops located in different areas of Rome. The dataset, generated using https://mockaroo.com/, contains **299 orders** distributed across **three years (2024–2025)**. Each order includes 1–3 items with associated prices.

The dashboard aims to provide:
- A clear view of **overall sales trends** over the last three years.
- **Revenue breakdown by product type** (Cappuccino, Espresso, etc.).
- Year-over-year comparison of revenues with filtering capabilities.


## ❓ Business Questions
1. **What is the total revenue generated by each coffee shop over the last three years?**
2. **Which product type contributes the most to overall revenue?**
3. **How do revenues compare across different years?**
4. **What is the percentage change in sales for each product compared to the previous year?**
5. **Are there any seasonal or yearly trends in product sales?**
6. 

## Key Features

First of all, I created a dataset, using https://mockaroo.com/, made of one excel file containing Sales data. The file contains the sales data of 6 coffee shops in different areas of Rome, selling 4 different types of product. There is 299 different orders distributed along 3 years (2024-2025). Every order can have from 1 to 3 items, each represented in a different columns, with a price column aside

**Goal: creating a single page dashboard that represent the overall sales trend of the shops along the last 3 years. The Dashboard should represent the revenues generated per type of product, and there should be the possibility to filter the year and see the comparison, in terms of revenues, with the previous year**

1.**Import data: Home** > **Get data** > **Text/CSV**

2.**Transform Data** > **Remove Column** (unecessary columns) > **Reorder Column** (in order to have the primary key as first column) > **Remove Duplicates**

3.**Create new measure**, called 'product' Revenues (in this case 'Cappuccino'), using `SUMX`. Then doing the same for all the 4 products

`

    Var prod1=SUMX(
    filter(Sales_data, Sales_data[product_1]="Cappuccino"), Sales_data[sales_id]
    )
    VAR prod2=SUMX(
    filter(Sales_data, Sales_data[product_2]="Cappuccino"), Sales_data[sales_id]
    )
     VAR prod3=SUMX(
    filter(Sales_data, Sales_data[product_3]="Cappuccino"), Sales_data[sales_id]
    )

    RETURN prod1+prod2+prod3

### Card "Revenues": 

4.**Visualizations** > **Add data to your visual** > **card**

5.**Add data to your visual** > drag measure Count of 'name of the product'  into Fields > select 

6.Creating 4 different card, each per every product

7.**Create new measure**, called 'product' Revenues (in this case 'Cappuccino'), using `COUNTX` to filter only the desired prodcut. Then doing the same for all the 4 products

`

    Var prod1=COUNTX(
    filter(Sales_data, Sales_data[product_1]="Espresso"), Sales_data[sales_id]
    )
    VAR prod2=COUNTX(
    filter(Sales_data, Sales_data[product_2]="Espresso"), Sales_data[sales_id]
    )
     VAR prod3=COUNTX(
    filter(Sales_data, Sales_data[product_3]="Espresso"), Sales_data[sales_id]
    )

    RETURN prod1+prod2+prod3

8.**Create new measure**, called Var % 'Product' Sales

`

    Var Sales_current_Y=CALCULATE([Count of Cappuccino])

    Var Sales_previous_Y=CALCULATE(
    [Count of Cappuccino], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Sales_data[sales_date].[Date])
    )

    RETURN (Sales_current_Y-Sales_previous_Y)/Sales_previous_Y


## ✅ Final Insights
- **Top-performing product:** Cappuccino consistently drives the highest revenue across all shops.
- **Year-over-year growth:** Overall sales increased by approximately **X%** from 2024 to 2025.
- **Shop performance:** Shop located in [Area Name] generated the highest revenue, while [Area Name] had the lowest.
- **Revenue distribution:** Espresso and Latte show steady growth, while Americano remains the least popular.
- **Seasonality:** Peak sales occur during [Month/Season], indicating potential promotional opportunities.
